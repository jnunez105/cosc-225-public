        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Jason Nunez. I am a 3rd year undergraduate at Amherst College, 
            majoring in Computer Science and Black Studies.</p>
        
        <h3>Cooking experience</h3>
        <p>I <em>love</em> cooking. I do not have a lot of experience, but to enjoy an art like cooking does not require that much expereince. All art is consumed somehow, but no art can be consumed like the art of cooking can be consumed. The heat, the seasonings, the timing, and of course, the biological demand for the art: <strong>the hunger.</strong> Would you consider me an artist? These are my favorite dishes to make:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice and beans</li>
            <li>Chicken parmesan</li>
            <li>Ramen with a fried egg on top</li>
            <li>Mangu, fried cheese, and salami (an iconic Dominican breakfast)</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Computer science experience</h3>
        <p>I sorta love programming. The art of programming is not always... tasteful like cooking, but it is worth mentioning. I was introduced to programming in an elective course when I was a junior, the first course to teach coding at my high school. We played with Arduino boards and coded various user-interfaced card games. I did not code again until Amherst College. I have taken two intro courses, data structures, computer systems, and a few elective courses. Undeniably, the biggest supporter of my computer science endeavors has been Professor William Rosenbaum, who has been my instructor three different times. Critical of his own handwriting, Rosenbaum teaches and answers all questions with clarity and grace. Outside of school, I worked on a machine learning project at an REU at the New York Institute of Technology. The project examined the privacy-preservation metrics of emotion recognition (for more information, click <a href="nyit_poster.pdf">here</a>). Anyways, here are all the programming languages I have learned in order: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Assembly</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>Haskell, FORTRAN, and cobol</li>
        </ol>
